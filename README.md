# Smart-Contract
This project is to create a safe remote purchase without any kind of identity or financial fraud between a customer and seller.
According to Google, a smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.

In this specific research paper, a smart contract “can be encoded with the rules of a contract in computer code, which is replicated and executed across the blockchain’s nodes. Such a contract can be self-enforcing, monitoring external inputs from a trusted sources such as a financial exchange.” (Panayi & Peters, 7)

In the real world, a smart contract can be a way of solidifying a transaction between a customer and a merchant so there is no chance of fraud.
